ICA-8 Testing (individual)

Problem Description:
In a men's washroom, only alternate urinals can be occupied(based on wide surveys conducted). So, this program takes a file of strings that contain )s and 1s, where 0 represents if the urinal is unoccupied and 1 represents if the urinal is occupied. It then gives the number of urinals that can be occupied based on the alternate urinal rule. The output is written in 'rule.txt'.

Please run the main class to get solution for urinal occupancy problem. The input for the main function is stored in 'myfile.dat'.

Please run 'UrinalsTest.java' under test to run the junit tests on four functions.
